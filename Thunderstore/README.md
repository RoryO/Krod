## What?

An item pack adding 20(-ish) new items, with a focus on making decisions and filling gaps in the base game.

## Full(-ish) Spoilers

I strongly suggest you refrain from reading a spoiler list. Let yourself have the joy of discovery. Much of the design doesn't come through accurately "on paper" by just reading descriptions, rather through discovering and trying interactions on your own.

you can see most of the items in the [spoiler](https://github.com/RoryO/Krod/blob/master/SPOILERS.md) document.
