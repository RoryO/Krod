| Name | Long Description | Design Notes |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| ![AileensEye](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84927b58-71dc-4e7d-ab82-119f9dac96e1) Aileen's Glass Eye | Creates a scrapper. Cracks on use. | Sometimes you never see a scrapper, sometimes you get four per stage the whole run. This is an insurance item. Less powerful than recycler. |
| ![AncientRecordingSystem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99d475d5-f3ab-4e88-8969-55098c56a7cb) Ancient Recording System | Every second, records all of your damage. Activate to stun and inflict your best recorded damage to the target. | The base game equipment mostly lacks anything you want. Card and recycler you always want, all of the damage dealing ones don't scale. While doesn't come across on paper, this is an absolute monster of a damage output for burst characters. Once it heats up, it becomes "use equipment, remove target". A little overtuned as it's damage output can reach hundreds of thousands in late game. |
| ![JeffsServiceMedal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e22edc6e-a837-4caf-8365-a08365dfbe46) Jeff's Service Medal | Creates a formation of friendly Alpha Constructs. | An inspiration from a friend who fought a Xi Construct alone for an hour. After implementing it was suprisingly way more powerful than I thought, hence the long cooldown. Those little triangles can take hits and deal damage. When they wake up. Drop next to a teleporter when you hit it and it gets way less hectic. |
| ![JeremiahsAccident](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a67678e-d380-415f-9b6a-418647ebc5b4) Jeremiah's Accident | Shoots a piercing bullet with infinite range for 1,600% damage. Causes enemies to explode if the bullet overkills by over 50% of its max health. Executes non-flying, non-boss elites in the air. | High damage, high skill, high uptime. Great with a breaching fin. You can finesse a golden golem into the air and then one shot it. Feels good man. |
| ![ArcadeToken](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93de0641-04ed-472f-b767-85d52a3a62c3) Arcade Token | Allows one purchase of a multi-shop while keeping the shop open. Removed from inventory after using. | The king of having you make decisions. Deceptively simple. My favorite test with this is when a token printer, a scrapper, and a bunch of white tri shops appeared early in a multiplayer game. We had to spend quite some time trying to solve the puzzle on how to rob the stage of everything we wanted. |
| ![DiscountCoffee](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3db7e48-b3c2-42ce-8c8b-ba9664b35e93) Discount Coffee | Increase sprint speed by 25% (+25% per stack) and attack speed by 15% (+15% per stack) for 60 seconds (+10 seconds per stack). Timer resets when making a purchase with money. | Meant to fill in gaps of an early game damage and speed boost, and scrapper feed later. The stats are equal to one temporary energy drink and syringe. Stacking a few isn't terrible mid game. |
| ![LooseCards](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0929979-bc08-4113-81ab-89b1090e475e) Loose TCG Cards | 5% (+2.5% per stack) chance on hit to apply a random damage over time debuff. Debuff chosen on stage start. | Adds some neat randomization and access to DoTs you don't normally, like lunar ruin and hemmorage |
| ![MisterBoinky](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/414de918-a15e-4c20-a819-51a9f0e15318) Mister Boinky | Blocks one hit dealing 25% or more damage, and become invulnerable for 5 seconds. Consumed on use. | This goofy little thing ended up being a "fan favorite", and the design just did not live up to it. Added a secret evolution path as a huge glow up so it lives up to expectations. |
| ![WeightedDice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6026e4-8207-45ce-891f-1da4f9964fc3) Weighted Dice | Rolls dice. 30% chance of a lucky roll to gain one luck for 30 seconds (+20s per stack). 10% chance of an unlucky roll to lose one luck for one minute (-20% per stack). Otherwise, does nothing and rolls again after 1 minute. Roll again when gaining or losing luck. | Discarded the idea in my head initially. Luck is a monster stat in this game and easily overpowering. Adding some cues, and reducing the uptime, made this feel much better. It adds some flow on something to check. When it goes negative, it makes you consider you should not take that fight right now. Or when positive, it's go time. |
| ![DoubleFish](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5f301de-7b7d-4fbc-8c51-38c7e29226e7) Double Fish | 2.5% (+2.5% per stack) chance of duplicating an attack. | Interesting way of getting to the overpowered autopilot end game. It has a chance to copy any attack and all of its properties completely, so it can double up on DoTs and proc chains. |
| ![NinjaShowerScrub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbee541c-da00-47a5-ae61-966cb75f5a27) Ninja Shower Scrub | Adds 5% crit chance. On a critical hit, give 1 (+1 per stack) shuriken to all allies within 20m. | Adapted from a suggestion, which seemed like the intent was more of a team cohesion item. When implementing, I realized that handing out ninja stars to all teammates meant drones and minions. Which turned this into Temu Drone Parts. |
| ![TheExtra](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf32c79-e62d-45cd-9aa3-81375b07af0a) The Extra | Every 8 seconds, while in combat, set enemies within 30m (+5m per stack) around you on fire. | Adding an avenue for AoE, which is powerful and necessary getting past mid game. I don't understand the ignite formula, so this was just screwing with it until it felt okay. |
| ![ToyMotorcycle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9ce193-56f2-4f29-9b60-c31bb5cd9745) Toy Motorcycle | Increases sprint speed by 10%(+5% per stack) for each green item in your inventory. Increases sprint speed for each scrap item in your inventory. Rarer scrap has a stronger effect. | If you're hurting for speed, this is welcome. If you already have enough, you don't want it. As you start growing in power, it gets uncontrollable. Then you have to decide if getting rid of it is worth the speed cost. |
| ![WoodHat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3e0278-d8db-4302-823f-96984b81fb10) A Wood Hat | Every 2 seconds, when not sprinting, adds one Wood Armor, up to a max of 2 (+2 per stack). Wood Armor reduces the damage of one hit by 50% and removes one stack. | Filling a damage reduction gap in the item pool. Went through a revision from just adding armor to a one shot renewable 50% damage reduction. Scrap candidate on already beefy characters. |
| ![TimsCrucible](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fe66a4e-fac4-4d12-9fb0-17d1a8f09d42) Tim's Crucible | Negates all fire damage. While on fire, increases armor by 20 (+20 per stack), attack speed by 30% (+30% per stack), and movement speed by 20% (+20% per stack). Using your utility skill lights you on fire for 2.5 (+0.5 seconds per stack), maximum of 7.5 seconds. | The first, silly idea I had. One person in our group is always dying to fire. The self ignition is to make it so it's actually usable. |
| ![RorysForsight](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c791191-b0b6-4263-974c-eff92b80489c) Rory's Forsight | Manifest the future. | The second idea I had, and the one I dreaded the most implementing and left it for last. While the basic implemention isn't too bad, sale stars and chance dolls really mess with this in a multiplayer context. Needs some more visual feedback on the inspected items. |
| ![AlienGodHand](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf515a3-8124-4f0d-a9e6-e2b3b7c63da5) Alien God Hand | Activating primary skill reduces the cooldown of the secondary skill by 1s (+0.25 s per stack). Activating the secondary skill reduces the cooldown of the utility skill by 1s (+0.5s per stack). Activating utility skill reduces the cooldown of the primary and special skills by 1s (+0.5s per stack). Activating the special skill reset the cooldowns of all other skills. | Inspired by "God Hand", an early spectacle brawling game with a focus on long combos. Good fun on characters with long cooldowns and people who have high APM with MOBAs. |
| ![PrismaticCoral](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573a0230-611b-44a8-ac98-46cba61f3d55) Prismatic Coral | Used in any 3D printer. Regular scrap takes priority. Removed from inventory on use. Corrupts all used and unused Regenerating Scrap. | Interesting way of fixing the scrap pool. It's rare you have compatible yellow or red scrap when you actually want it. Other interesting design space is it lets you get out of the transformed state, since using the coral removes it from the inventory. Opens up more economy puzzles and options. Enormous pain to implement with how the game sets up buying things internally. |
| ![CaudalFin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83de7779-df55-4f56-a72c-7094f2fc2a51) Caudal Fin | While sprinting, hold jump to increase speed by 50% (+50% per stack). Release jump to leap into the air relative to your speed. Corrupts all Hopoo Feathers. | A design challenge of "why would you ever trade a feather"? Trades vertical mobility for velocity and height. Meant to fit the void oceanic theme, as to feel like aquatic creature buliding up speed and leaping out of the water. |
| ![ShipOfRegret](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09e411e9-5e28-4eb7-99a9-e8810431da61) Ship of Regret | Gain the equivalent of one (+1 per stack) large chest of gold every minute. Elite monsters give 300% (+300% per stack) more gold. Regular non-boss monsters do not give gold, instead accumulates Regret (+100% more per stack). You cannot exit a stage while you have Regret. Regret fades when acquiring gold. | Common complaint about lunar items is the penalty isn't harsh enough, if there is a penalty at all. Here you can blaze through stages at half the time, if you're careful. Otherwise, the penality of literally not being able to leave can slow you down considerably. You can mitigate it by thinking around it by leaving elites, barrels, and combat shrines after the teleporter, where the penalty removal is 4x normal. |
